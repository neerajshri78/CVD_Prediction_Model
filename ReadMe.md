# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model - Data Mining Project

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

## Overview 
This repository contains the code and the documentation for a Data Mining and ML project focussed on predicting cardiovascular disease
The project explores various data mining techniques such as feature engineering, binning, cluster methodologies & Outlier removals
also explores models like Gaussian Naive Byes, Logistics Regression, Random Forest, ANN to predict mortality due to CVD diseases.

## Data Set

The dataset employed in this project encompasses 70,000 entries,
consisting of 13 numerical features, including age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure values (ap_hi and ap_lo), cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking and alcohol habits, physical activity, and the target variableâ€”cardiovascular disease (CVD).
After thorough preprocessing, including outlier removal and feature engineering, the data was prepared for experimentation.

## CVD Modelling

Applied four machine learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction:
-	Gaussian Naive Bayes
-	Decision Tree Classifier
-	Random Forest
-	Logistic Regression
-	Artificial Neural network

## How to Use

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirement.txt`.
3. Execute the main script or Jupyter notebooks to train and evaluate the models.
